There is a kindly family live in a small town.
The family members: father-John, mother-Emily, son-Jeff, daughter:Kathy

One day, they go to a shopping mall. In the fresh market, this family find something special, a glowing guacamole.

The glowing guacamole spoke to them in its creamy green voice.
It said, "I am he who travels. Speak, so that I may remember thee and spare your souls in the coming fray.

The family decided to buy the glowing guacamole. They ate it for dinner that night.

After their meal, they felt very unusual for hours. While they were sleeping, they awoke to the guacamole in their stomach glowing! "You shouldn't have done that.." the guacamole in them growled fearsomely.
